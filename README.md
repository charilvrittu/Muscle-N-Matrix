This project presents the development of a dynamic Fitness app website, 
designed to provide users with a seamless browsing experience for fitness 
plans and workout routines. The website was built using only frontend 
technologies, including HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling and 
layout, and JavaScript for adding interactivity. 
The website features a clean and responsive design, enabling users to explore 
and preview fitness programs across different categories. JavaScript was 
utilized to implement key functionalities, such as dynamic filtering of workout 
plans, interactive progress tracking, and user controls for workout 
customization. Additionally, the website ensures compatibility across various 
screen sizes, providing an optimized experience for both desktop and mobile 
users. 
This project demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to building visually 
appealing and user-friendly websites using only frontend tools. The final 
product showcases the power of these technologies in creating a highly 
interactive platform without the need for backend development. The website 
fulfils its goal of offering a smooth and intuitive interface for selecting and 
following fitness routines.
